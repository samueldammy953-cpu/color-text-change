# color-text-change
Good morning/afternoon/evening sir

In this project i created a Color Theme Switcher which will change the Background Color from 
Dark mode to Light mode and from Light mode to Dark mode by clicking on a button on the page

And i got the idea of this project from the Light bulb Switch we did in class

I watch a similar video  online but i didn't copy the code

Thank you sir for your time
